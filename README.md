Linear and Logistic Regression Models

This project explores the concepts of Linear and Logistic Regression, two fundamental algorithms in machine learning used for predicting numerical values and binary classification, respectively. The implementations are done from scratch using Python and NumPy, providing a clear understanding of how these algorithms function.

1. Linear Regression
 
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to predict continuous values based on the input features by fitting a linear equation to the data.

Concept:

The model tries to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference (error) between the predicted values and the actual values.
The parameters (weights) of the model are adjusted using gradient descent, an optimization algorithm that minimizes the mean squared error by iteratively updating the weights.

Implementation Details:

The implementation initializes the model parameters, including a bias term (intercept) for better accuracy.
Gradient descent is applied to optimize the model by updating the weights iteratively based on the calculated gradients.
The model learns from the training data and can predict new values based on unseen inputs.

2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values, Logistic Regression estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class (e.g., class 0 or class 1).

Concept:

The model uses the sigmoid function to convert the linear output into a probability value between 0 and 1.
A decision boundary is set (usually 0.5) to classify the output; if the probability is greater than or equal to the threshold, it predicts one class, otherwise the other.
The algorithm optimizes the model using cross-entropy loss, which measures the performance of the model and adjusts the weights accordingly through gradient descent.

Implementation Details:

The implementation begins by initializing the parameters and transforming the input data with an intercept term.
The model uses the sigmoid function to calculate probabilities and the gradient function to minimize errors through iterative weight updates.
The final model can predict the class of new inputs by applying the trained logistic function.

Summary
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing Linear and Logistic Regression models, offering insight into their mechanics and applications in predictive modeling and binary classification tasks.
